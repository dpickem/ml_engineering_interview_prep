# LLM Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains notebooks and code implementations based on the book:

**"Build a Large Language Model From Scratch"** by Sebastian Raschka ([@rasbt](https://github.com/rasbt))

## Overview

The notebooks in this folder follow the concepts, techniques, and implementations presented in Sebastian Raschka's book on building large language models from the ground up. These materials are meant for educational purposes to understand the inner workings of transformer-based language models.

## Acknowledgment

All concepts, architectures, and implementation approaches are credited to Sebastian Raschka's work. This repository serves as my personal implementation and notes while working through the book's content.
