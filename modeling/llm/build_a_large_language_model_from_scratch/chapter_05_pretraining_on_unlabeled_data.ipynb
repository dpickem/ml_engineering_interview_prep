The unit “bits” arises because we’re working in the context of binary information encoding. Intuitively, each bit represents a yes/no choice, and the cross-entropy tells us, on average, how many such choices we’d need to make to encode the true outcomes from $p$, given that our model assigns probabilities according to $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $q$ perfectly matches $p$, the encoding is as efficient as possible—this is essentially the entropy $H(p)$ of the true distribution.  \n",
    "- If $q$ differs from $p$, the encoder based on $q$ will make less informed decisions, leading to longer or more error-prone codes on average.  \n",
    "- The “lower” cross-entropy means we’re closer to the ideal scenario where $q \\approx p$, which indicates our model (represented by $q$) is doing a better job of approximating the true distribution $p$.  \n",
    "- Conversely, a higher cross-entropy indicates that $q$ diverges significantly from $p$, causing inefficiencies and increasing the average number of bits needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity), in information theory, perplexity is a measure of uncertainty in the value of a sample from a discrete probability distribution. The larger the perplexity, the less likely it is that an observer can guess the value which will be drawn from the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[From Sebastian Raschka's book:](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is a measure often used alongside cross entropy loss to evaluate the performance of models in tasks like language modeling. It can provide a more interpretable way to understand the uncertainty of a model in predicting the next token in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity measures how well the probability distribution predicted by the model matches the actual distribution of the words in the dataset. Similar to the loss, a lower perplexity indicates that the model predictions are closer to the actual distribution. Perplexity can be calculated as ```perplexity = torch.exp(loss)```, which returns ```tensor(48725.8203)``` when applied to the previously calculated loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is often considered more interpretable than the raw loss value because it signifies the effective vocabulary size about which the model is uncertain at each step. In the given example, this would translate to the model being unsure about which among 48,725 tokens in the vocabulary to generate as the next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/c/67f355f7-0c14-800f-84ad-1fa039a6025d) provides a similar intuitive explanation. If we consider a language model predicting the next word in a sentence, perplexity provides a numerical summary of how uncertain or \"perplexed\" the model is, on average, when choosing among possible outcomes. A perplexity value of 10, for example, indicates that the model’s uncertainty is equivalent to having 10 equally likely choices for each word it predicts. In other words, lower perplexity means the model is more confident in its predictions, as it can narrow down the possible outcomes to a smaller, more focused set. Higher perplexity indicates greater uncertainty or poorer model performance, since the model must spread its probability mass across more outcomes, essentially \"considering\" a larger range of possibilities before making a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation of perplexity as a kind of \"average branching factor\" makes it particularly useful in evaluating the quality of language models. Instead of dealing with abstract bits or logarithms (as in cross-entropy), perplexity translates the model’s predictive efficiency into a form that’s more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Suppose a language model predicts a sentence like “The cat sat on the ____” with probabilities for possible words:  \n",
    "  - $p(\\text{mat})$ = 0.8, $p(\\text{floor})$ = 0.15, $p(\\text{roof})$ = 0.05\n",
    "  - If the true word is “mat” and the model’s probabilities closely match this, the perplexity will be low.  \n",
    "  - If the model assigns much lower probability to “mat” and higher to other options, the perplexity will increase, indicating worse predictions.\n"

    "### Comparing the Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Entropy vs. KL Divergence**:  \n",
    "   - Cross-entropy combines the entropy of $p$, which is fixed for a given $p$, and the KL divergence from $p$ to $q$:  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     H(p, q) = H(p) + D_{KL}(p \\parallel q)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - While cross-entropy measures the total coding cost under $q$, KL divergence isolates the inefficiency due to $q$’s divergence from $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perplexity and Cross-Entropy**:  \n",
    "   - Perplexity is derived directly from cross-entropy, converting the measure into an interpretable “average number of choices.” It essentially provides a more human-readable version of the model’s performance.  \n",
    "   - Both low perplexity and low cross-entropy indicate a better model fit, but perplexity is the exponential form and gives a more intuitive sense of the model’s uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perplexity and KL Divergence**:  \n",
    "   - While perplexity is connected to cross-entropy, KL divergence is a more nuanced measure that focuses on how much $q$ deviates from $p$ rather than the raw efficiency of encoding.  \n",
    "   - Perplexity doesn’t directly measure divergence; instead, it measures how well the model predicts, which can be related to divergence indirectly through the cross-entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, cross-entropy and perplexity are practical metrics for evaluating how well a predictive model matches a true distribution, with perplexity offering a more intuitive interpretation. KL divergence, on the other hand, is a more fundamental information-theoretic measure that quantifies how much one distribution differs from another, forming a building block for understanding the inefficiencies captured by cross-entropy."
